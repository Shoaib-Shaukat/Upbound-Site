            <h5>Compliance; Assessments; Waiver</h5>
            <p>Failure by any Supplier to comply with any of these expectations and standards will require the Supplier

                the termination of the contract(s) between the Company and Supplier. Suppliers are expected to cooperate
                with the Company and allow the Company or its designee to conduct audits to verify compliance with this
                Code or other required certifications. In the event any deficiencies are identified as a result of any
                such audit, Supplier shall promptly take the steps necessary to correct any deficiency to the Company's
                satisfaction. No action or inaction by the Company shall be construed as a waiver of any rights
                contained herein or the applicability of this Code to any other Supplier.</p>
            <h5>Reporting Concern</h5>
            <p>Any questions or concerns, or suspicion that any Supplier may have violated this Code or otherwise
                engaged in illegal or improper conduct, should be immediately reported to the Company by contacting the
                Company's Compliance Officer at compliance@rentacenter.com. Suppliers are expected to provide assistance
                to the Company in the investigation of any concerns involving the Company or a Supplier. Because Company
                policy prohibits retaliation against any person reporting any concerns regarding a violation of this
                Code, please immediately report any instances of suspected retaliation.</p>
