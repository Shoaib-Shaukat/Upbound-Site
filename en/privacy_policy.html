            <h5>5. Nevada Users’ Rights</h5>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
                Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of certain personally
                identifiable information (“Covered Information”) for monetary consideration to a person for that
                person to license or sell such information to additional persons. “Covered Information” includes
                first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security number, an identifier
                that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online, or any other
                information
                concerning a person collected from the person through our website and maintained in combination
                with
                an identifier in a form that makes the information personally identifiable.
            </p>
            <p>If you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or services from us, you may (A)
                submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales, and/or (B) request changes to your
                covered information by clicking here</p>
            <h5>6. Advertising and Marketing Choice</h5>
            <p>We respect your rights in how your personal information is used and shared. If at any time you
                would
                like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can follow the instructions at the bottom
                of
                each email, and we will promptly remove you from correspondence. Please note, however, that we
                may
                still need to contact you regarding other matters.
            </p>
            <h5>7. How Long Is Your Personal Information Kept</h5>
            <p>We will retain your personal information until the personal information is no longer necessary to
                accomplish the purpose for which it was provided. We may retain your personal information for
                longer
                periods for specific purposes to the extent that we are obliged to do so in accordance with
                applicable laws and regulations, to protect you, other people, and us from fraud, abuse, an
                unauthorized access, as necessary to protect our legal rights, or for certain business
                requirements.
            </p>
            <p>We will delete your personal information when it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which
                it
                was collected, or upon your request, subject to exceptions as discussed in this Statement or
                under
                applicable law, contract, or regulation. </p>
            <h5>8. Our Commitment to Data Security</h5>
            <p>The Company will use appropriate security measures to protect your information from unauthorized
                access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction in a secure, controlled environment. The Company
                has
                made substantial investments in server, database, backup, and firewall technologies to protect

                security and integrity of your information. However, we cannot and do not guarantee complete
                security, as it does not exist on the Internet. In the event that a security breach does occur
                and
                your information is acquired by an unauthorized person, we will take appropriate steps to
                contain
                the breach and to notify you of the unauthorized acquisition as required by law.</p>
            <p>However, we cannot and do not guarantee complete security, as it does not exist on the Internet.
